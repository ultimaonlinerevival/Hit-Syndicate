      <p>
        Hit Syndicate is an organized guild built around coordinated PvP and PvM.
        We use a crime-syndicate theme for identity and structure, but the focus is
        simple: play together, run events, and keep it fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobody gets controlled here. Play solo when you want. If we’re raiding or
        fighting and you’re online, you’re not “required” to show up. The only real
        expectation is that when we choose to fight together, we don’t scatter.
      </p>
      <p>
        We run PvP (duels, town/field fights, tournaments, and off-meta ideas) and
        PvM (treasure maps, champ spawns, raids, and end-game like Doom, Roof, and
        underwater bosses). We also do custom games and quest-style events built
        for the guild.
