          <p>
            Hit Syndicate is an organized Ultima Online guild built around coordinated PvP and PvM,
            using a crime-syndicate theme for identity and structure while keeping the focus on
            group play and having fun.
          </p>

          <p>
            Members are free to play how they want. Solo play is fine, doing your own thing is fine,
            and no one is required to drop what they’re doing to join an event. The only expectation
            is simple: when we choose to fight or raid together, we do it together. If we’re
            outnumbered, we don’t scatter. We stand, learn, and go again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our time is split between PvP and PvM. PvP includes duels, town fights, field fights,
            tournaments, and experimenting with ideas that don’t always follow the meta. PvM
            includes treasure maps, champ spawns, raids, and end-game encounters such as Doom,
            the Roof, and underwater bosses. We also run custom events and quest-style activities
            created specifically for the guild.
          </p>

          <p>
            Members regularly help each other with skill training, building suits, acquiring gear,
            and refining templates. The goal is to lift each other up so everyone can play what they
            enjoy and feel confident doing it.
          </p>

          <h2>Joining</h2>
          <p>
            Joining starts in Discord. New members introduce themselves, participate in a trial run
            or event, and receive an invite from there. Activity, attitude, and fit matter more than
            anything else.
